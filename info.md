## An Australian BoM alternative using WillyWeather

www.willyweather.com.au provide a cheap API that is more usable than the BoM API.

The advantage is that they source data for your location from the closest weather stations, rather than you choosing a specific weather station.

This is much better if you are in a rural area and the closest weather station does not provide all data.

### Setup
You will need to obtain an API key from https://www.willyweather.com.au/account/api.html

Full instructions in the README.md

### Configuration
```
sensor:
  - platform: willyweather
    api_key: your_api_key

```
